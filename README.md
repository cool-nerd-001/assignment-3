# NLP & Transformer Exercises

This repository contains solutions for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based assignments implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

- **Assignment_3.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the following tasks:
  1. **Character-level RNN for Text Generation**: LSTM-based model to predict next character and generate text with temperature scaling.
  2. **NLP Preprocessing Pipeline**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming using NLTK.
  3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract named entities with spaCy and print their labels and offsets.
  4. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: NumPy implementation of the attention mechanism with example matrices.
  5. **Sentiment Classifier**: Hugging Face `transformers` pipeline for sentiment analysis.
  6. **Short Answer & Conceptual Questions**: Markdown cells covering topics like stemming vs. lemmatization, NER vs. POS tagging, BERT vs. GPT, etc.
